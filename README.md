### About me

I recieved my Bachelor's degree in mathematics and statistics from Rice University in 2014. I recieved my PhD in mathematics, with dissertation "Efficient Computation on Reeb Spaces and First Homology Groups", from Purdue University in 2021. Additionally, I was a summer intern at IBM in 2020 and 2021. I am now a TEAM-UP postdoc at Michigan State University in the department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. My research investigates both theoretical and applied problems in computational topology.
