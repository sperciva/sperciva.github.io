### About me

I am a TEAM-UP postdoc at Michigan State University in the department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. My research involves using topological data analysis to study protein folding as part of a collaboration with PIs Dan Chitwood, Alex Dickson, and Liz Munch.

**Research Interests**
* Computational topology
* Topological data analysis
* Reeb spaces
* Mathematics and biology

[You can find my CV here](CV_2022.pdf)

**Events**

I am co-organizing [a workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/mobius-inversion-workshop) at SoCG 2023 on Mobius Inversions and Reeb Spaces.
