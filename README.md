### About me

I am a fixed-term Assistant Professor at Michigan State University in the department of Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. My research involves using computational topology to explore biological questions as part of a collaboration with PIs Arjun Krishnan and Liz Munch.

In August 2024, I will be joining the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New Mexico as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor.

**Research Interests**
* Computational topology
* Topological data analysis
* Reeb spaces
* Mathematics and biology
